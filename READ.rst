Sphinx makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.

Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils.

Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents and children
Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index
Code highlighting: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
Templating: Flexible HTML output using the Jinja 2 templating engine
