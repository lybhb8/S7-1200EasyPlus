Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: copy_logo_images(app, exception=None)

   
   Copy logo image to the _static directory.

   If logo image paths are given, copy them to the `_static` folder Then we can link to them directly in an html_page_context event.

.. py:function:: setup_logo_path(app, pagename, templatename, context, doctree)

   
   Set up relative paths to logos in our HTML templates.

   In Sphinx, the context["logo"] is a path to the `html_logo` image now in the output
   `_static` folder.

   If logo["image_light"] and logo["image_dark"] are given, we must modify them to
   follow the same pattern. They have already been copied to the output folder
   in the `update_config` event.
